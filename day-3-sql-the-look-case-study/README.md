# Case Study: Data Analytics for The Look E-commerce

The Look database is an open access data of a fictitious fashion ecommerce available in Google BigQuery.

This project is the case study assignment from the 1-week Data Analytics Mini Course from RevoU. To know more about the programme, proceed to below page.

#### Challenge Brief

You are the data analyst of The Look eCommerce. There are seven tables in the database, but you only need to focus on three. 
- From the orders, orders_items, and products table.
- List down three trends/points that you want to show.
- Explore, transform, filter, and prepare the data.
- Create the data visualisation.
- Make slides with the insights to the stakeholders.

#### Business Questions

1. What are the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on online purchases?
2. What is the biggest profit generator for The Look?
3. What causes product returns and how can we make user experience better?

## Pre-requisites
