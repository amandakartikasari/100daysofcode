# My #100daysofcode Code Bank
Hello! I am currently learning data analytics. My focus of study is SQL, Phyton, and Data Viz.
I also do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript occassionally just because I need to develop my own website as a solo entrepreneur.
You will find a mix of different projects in my #100daysofcode source, feel free to find interesting case studies relevant to your interest!
